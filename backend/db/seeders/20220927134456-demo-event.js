      "Hudson Valley is still full of fall colors. There aren't too many places that are synonyms with Halloween than Sleepy Hollow, the home of the Headless Horseman. Let's visit this charming town, check out the statue of the Headless Horseman and walk through the spooky Sleepy Hollow cemetery. Full of grandiose and opulent mausoleums that are home to many famous figures, including Washington Irving who wrote 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'. And other famous historical individuals including various Carnegie and Rockefeller family members. We will also tour Kykuit Estate, gardens and Philips Manor. This Rockefeller estate has been closed during the pandemic but is finally offering tours. With rich and troubled history, we will journey to Colonial America of 1750 where 23 enslaved individuals called Phillips Manor home. We will also have a nice dinner together after our visit and tour. We will meet in the city and travel together in a comfortable passenger van. The cost of the trip, including the Kykuit estate tour is $95",
